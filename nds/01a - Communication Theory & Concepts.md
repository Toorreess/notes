# Computer Networks
### Definition
A **computer** or **data network** is a group of two or more *computing devices* inked together by means of a transmission media.

### Network components
DTE-DCE standards try to define the mechanical, electrical and functional characteristics of connection between the DTE and DCE.
- **DTE**: Data Terminal Equipment; e.g. a computer, a sensor...
- **DCE**: Data Communication Equipment; e.g. modem ADSL, router...

### Distributed Systems
A **distributed system** is a computing system where the location of *resources* (e.g. services, files, databases, etc.) is transparent for the user, with the purpose of being managed **by a single virtual machine**.

### Services and Distributed applications
Application software executed on multiple computing devices within a network, which interact through **message passing**. E.g.: Web, email, VoIP, P2P file sharing...

Unlike computer networks whose point of view is the infrastructure of communications, distributed systems is that of **software processes**.



# Data Transmission
## Physical Structures
Computing devices in a network are connected through links. A link is a communication pathway to transfer data from one device to another. 
As to types of connections, there are different types:
- **Point-to-point**: is a dedicated link between two devices.

- **Multipoint**: +2 devices share a single link.

The physical topology refers to the structure of the physical network. This can be represented by geometric graphs.

### Mesh networks
- **Fully connected**: Every device has a dedicated point-to-point link every other device. Too costly: $\frac{N\cdot (N-1)}{2}$.

- **Partially connected**: The problem is to find a pathway from every device to every other device. This can be resolved by **switching**. A **switched network** consists of a series of interlinked nodes, called *switches*, devices capable of creating temporal connections between +2 devices linked to the switch.
	- **Circuit-switched networks**: The stations make a reservation of the resources to be used during the communication. E.g.: Traditional Telephone Network.![[Pasted image 20240229095353.png]]
	- **Packet-switched networks**: Both the links and the switches (i.e. routers) are shared between devices. (E.g.: Internet). With the *store-and-forward* technique, the packet is sent to an intermediate station where it is kept and sent at a later time to the final destination or to another intermediate station.

### Broadcast Topologies
They have a central node or transmission media shared by all the stations.
- **Star topology**: This consists of a central node (hub), to which all other nodes are connected. ![[Pasted image 20240229100013.png]]
- **Bus topology**: One long cable acts as a backbone to link all the devices in a network. ![[Pasted image 20240229100037.png]]
- **Ring topology**: Messages circulate along the ring and each station can receive it. ![[Pasted image 20240229100202.png]]

## Bandwidth
- **Signal bandwidth (Hz)**: It is the range of frequences contained in a composite analog signal.
- **Digital bandwidth (bps)**: It is the upper bound on the rate of digital data that can be transmitted over a communication channel.

## Multiplexing 
Simultaneous transmission technique of multiple signals across a single data link.
### Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)
Analog signals generated by each device are sent in several distinct frequency ranges over a single channel. E.g.: FM radio broadcasting. ![[Pasted image 20240229101312.png]]

### Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)
Digital signals generated by each device are sent in different time slots. ![[Pasted image 20240229101432.png]]

#### FDM vs TDM

## Modulation
Is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal. Its purpose is to codify the information on the carrier wave and transmit it through multiple channels, using the FDM technique.

## ADSL Technology (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
It was the solution to a higher bandwitdth requirement, prioritizing **downstream** (Internet $\rightarrow$ Resident) over **upstream** (Resident $\rightarrow$ Internet), and using parallel channels. ![[Pasted image 20240229102854.png]]
Nowadays, xDSL technology is used in rural area and could be outstriped by 5G or other new technologies.

## Data Flow
- **Simplex**: Unidirectional communication (e.g. a keyboard).
- **Half-duplex**: each station can both transmit and receive, but alternatively (e.g. walkie-talkies).
- **Full-duplex**: both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously (e.g. telephone network).

## Performance
![[Pasted image 20240229105720.png]]
For measuring the network performance, we use:
- **Bandwidth**: an increase in bandwidth in Hz means an increase in bandwidth in bps.
- **Latency (delay)**: how long it takes for an entire message to completely arrive at the destination from the time the first bit is sent out from the source.
	-  *Propagation Time ($T_{prop}$)*: The time it takes a bit to arrive.
	- *Transmission Time ($T_{trans}$)*: The time it takes to send the whole message.
	- *Processing Time ($T_{process}$)*: The time it takes to the receiver to process a bit. 
- **Round Trip Time (RTT)**: Time required for a message to be transmitted and send back an acknowledge. 
### Formulas
$$
\begin{align}
T_{trans} &= \frac{\text{Message length (bits)}}{\text{Bandwidth (bps)}} \\ \\
T_{prop} &= \frac{\text{Distance (m)}}{\text{propagation speed (m/s)}} \\ \\
Latency &= T_{trans} + T_{prop} + T_{process} \\ \\
BW_{up} &= BW_{down} \Rightarrow RTT = 2 \cdot Latency
\end{align}
