# 1 Communication Theory & Concepts
## 1.1 Computer Networks
A **computer** or **data network** is a group of two or more *computing devices* inked together by means of a transmission media.
### 1.1.1 Network components
DTE-DCE standards try to define the mechanical, electrical and functional characteristics of connection between the DTE and DCE.
- **DTE**: Data Terminal Equipment; e.g. a computer, a sensor...
- **DCE**: Data Communication Equipment; e.g. modem ADSL, router...

### 1.1.2 Distributed Systems
A **distributed system** is a computing system where the location of *resources* (e.g. services, files, databases, etc.) is transparent for the user, with the purpose of being managed **by a single virtual machine**.

### 1.1.3 Services and Distributed applications
Application software executed on multiple computing devices within a network, which interact through **message passing**. E.g.: Web, email, VoIP, P2P file sharing...

Unlike computer networks whose point of view is the infrastructure of communications, distributed systems is that of **software processes**.


## 1.2 Data Transmission
### 1.2.1 Physical Structures
Computing devices in a network are connected through links. A link is a communication pathway to transfer data from one device to another. 
As to types of connections, there are different types:
- **Point-to-point**: is a dedicated link between two devices.
![[Pasted image 20240229094029.png]]
- **Multipoint**: +2 devices share a single link.
![[Pasted image 20240229094056.png]]

The physical topology refers to the structure of the physical network. This can be represented by geometric graphs.

#### Mesh networks
- **Fully connected**: Every device has a dedicated point-to-point link every other device. Too costly: $\frac{N\cdot (N-1)}{2}$.
![[Pasted image 20240229094623.png]]
- **Partially connected**: The problem is to find a pathway from every device to every other device. This can be resolved by **switching**. A **switched network** consists of a series of interlinked nodes, called *switches*, devices capable of creating temporal connections between +2 devices linked to the switch.
	- **Circuit-switched networks**: The stations make a reservation of the resources to be used during the communication. E.g.: Traditional Telephone Network.![[Pasted image 20240229095353.png]]
	- **Packet-switched networks**: Both the links and the switches (i.e. routers) are shared between devices. (E.g.: Internet). With the *store-and-forward* technique, the packet is sent to an intermediate station where it is kept and sent at a later time to the final destination or to another intermediate station.

#### Broadcast Topologies
They have a central node or transmission media shared by all the stations.
- **Star topology**: This consists of a central node (hub), to which all other nodes are connected. ![[Pasted image 20240229100013.png]]
- **Bus topology**: One long cable acts as a backbone to link all the devices in a network. ![[Pasted image 20240229100037.png]]
- **Ring topology**: Messages circulate along the ring and each station can receive it. ![[Pasted image 20240229100202.png]]

### 1.2.2 Bandwidth
- **Signal bandwidth (Hz)**: It is the range of frequences contained in a composite analog signal.
- **Digital bandwidth (bps)**: It is the upper bound on the rate of digital data that can be transmitted over a communication channel.

### 1.2.3 Multiplexing 
Simultaneous transmission technique of multiple signals across a single data link.
#### Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM)
Analog signals generated by each device are sent in several distinct frequency ranges over a single channel. E.g.: FM radio broadcasting. ![[Pasted image 20240229101312.png]]

#### Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM)
Digital signals generated by each device are sent in different time slots. ![[Pasted image 20240229101432.png]]

#### FDM vs TDM
![[Pasted image 20240229101631.png]]

### 1.2.4 Modulation
Is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal. Its purpose is to codify the information on the carrier wave and transmit it through multiple channels, using the FDM technique.

### 1.2.5 ADSL Technology (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
It was the solution to a higher bandwitdth requirement, prioritizing **downstream** (Internet $\rightarrow$ Resident) over **upstream** (Resident $\rightarrow$ Internet), and using parallel channels. ![[Pasted image 20240229102854.png]]
Nowadays, xDSL technology is used in rural area and could be outstriped by 5G or other new technologies.

### 1.2.6 Data Flow
- **Simplex**: Unidirectional communication (e.g. a keyboard).
- **Half-duplex**: each station can both transmit and receive, but alternatively (e.g. walkie-talkies).
- **Full-duplex**: both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously (e.g. telephone network).

### 1.2.7 Performance
![[Pasted image 20240229105720.png]]
For measuring the network performance, we use:
- **Bandwidth**: an increase in bandwidth in Hz means an increase in bandwidth in bps.
- **Latency (delay)**: how long it takes for an entire message to completely arrive at the destination from the time the first bit is sent out from the source.
	-  *Propagation Time ($T_{prop}$)*: The time it takes a bit to arrive.
	- *Transmission Time ($T_{trans}$)*: The time it takes to send the whole message.
	- *Processing Time ($T_{process}$)*: The time it takes to the receiver to process a bit. 
- **Round Trip Time (RTT)**: Time required for a message to be transmitted and send back an acknowledge. 
### 1.2.8 Formulas
$$
\begin{align}
T_{trans} &= \frac{\text{Message length (bits)}}{\text{Bandwidth (bps)}} \\ \\
T_{prop} &= \frac{\text{Distance (m)}}{\text{propagation speed (m/s)}} \\ \\
Latency &= T_{trans} + T_{prop} + T_{process} \\ \\
BW_{up} &= BW_{down} \Rightarrow RTT = 2 \cdot Latency
\end{align}
$$

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Private network for connecting computer devices inside an office, lab, building or small campus. E.g.: WiFi, Ethernet. Interconnections with hubs, bridges or switches.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Covers a larger area than LAN, inside a city, public or private. E.g.: FDDI, WiMAX. Interconnections with routers or switches.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: provides long-distance transmission of multimedia data, covering a broad area (i.e., a country, continent, the whole world) using private or public network transports, but with a high lattency of messages. Interconnections of MAN, LAN, PAN networks with routers and switches.


# 3 Network Layered Models & Standards Bodies
## 3.1 Layered Network Architectures
The communication functionality of computer networks is typically grouped in layers, as the reference model of OSI (*Open Systems Interconnection*) or the TCP/IP model of Internet.

![[Pasted image 20240229113419.png]]

### 3.1.1 Elements
- **The Layers**.
- **The Service interfaces**.
- **The protocols**.

## 3.2 Protocols
A *protocol* is a **set of standard rules** that defines **what** is communicated, **how** it is communicated, and **when** it is communicated. They are responsible of:
- The *syntax* or format of the data.
- The *semantics* of the messages and what action is to be taken at the reception of each message.
- The *timing* or order in which messages must be sent and received.

The communication between two computers is possible iff both computers implement the same protocol for each layer. The standard defines the protocols of the network architecture and its implementation is called **protocol stack**.

\*Note: Layer network architectures = Network protocol families = protocol suite

### 3.2.1 Classification
- **Connection oriented**: the source first makes a connection with the target before sending information. E.g.: the telephone, TCP.
- **Connectionless**: a connection is not needed to exchange information. E.g.: the postal mail, UDP.

## 3.3 Standards
### 3.3.1 Who standardizes communication technologies?
- **De facto**: Standards that have not been approved by an organized body but have been adopted as standards through widespread use are de facto standards.
- **De Jure**: Standards developed and approved by an official organisation.
	- *Governmental*
	- *Non-Governmental standards* (often non-profit orgs.)

#### Standards Bodies
- ISO (International Organization of Standarization)
- IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
- ITU-T (ITU Telecommunication Standarization Sector)
- IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
- W3C (World Wide Web Consortim)
### 3.3.2 OSI (Open System Interconnection)
The motivation is to standardize the communication technologies to achieve interoperability of computer networks.
#### Layers
7. **Application Layer**: Network processes as the @ of an email. Unit exchanged: *APDU*.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Security and *ASN (Abstract Syntax Notation)*. Unit exchanged: *PPDU*.
5. **Session Layer**: for organized multiconferences. Unit exchanged: *SPDU*. 
4. **Transport Layer**: Connect two processors without errors. Unit exchanged: *TPDU*.
3. **Network Layer**: Optimal path between two nodes. Unit exchanged: *packets*.
2. **Data Link Layer**: How are the data shared (point-to-point...). Unit exchanged: *frames*.
1. **Physical Layer**: Protocol and interface. Unit exchanged: *bits*.

It is based in **message encapsulation**. Each layer has a **header**, thus the size of the data will be increasing from application to physical layer in a way that, after the message arrives at the receiver, those headers will be interpreted with the specified protocol and reduced in each layer until arrive to the application layer. In the Data Link layer a fragment will be append to the message.

### 3.3.3 TCP/IP Protocol Suite
It defines fewer layers than OSI/RM, which are not necessarily interdependent as in OSI and can be implemented using different network access; it has numerous open source stacks and for many operating systems. 
#### Layers
4. **Application Layer**: Client-server paradigm and Standard Internet Services (FTP, HTTP, SMTP).
3. **Transport Layer**: Connection-oriented (TCP, Transmission Control Protocol) and connectionless (UDP, User Datagram Protocol).
2. **Internet Layer**: Connectionless internetworking protocol. (IP, Internet Protocol).
1. **Network Interface Layer**: The physical and Data Link layers.
