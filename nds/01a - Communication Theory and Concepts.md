## Computer Networks
### Definition
A **computer** or **data network** is a group of two or more *computing devices* inked together by means of a transmission media.

### Network components
DTE-DCE standards try to define the mechanical, electrical and functional characteristics of connection between the DTE and DCE.
- **DTE**: Data Terminal Equipment; e.g. a computer, a sensor...
- **DCE**: Data Communication Equipment; e.g. modem ADSL, router...

### Distributed Systems
A **distributed system** is a computing system where the location of *resources* (e.g. services, files, databases, etc.) is transparent for the user, with the purpose of being managed **by a single virtual machine**.

### Services and Distributed applications
Application software executed on multiple computing devices within a network, which interact through **message passing**. E.g.: Web, email, VoIP, P2P file sharing...

Unlike computer networks whose point of view is the infrastructure of communications, distributed systems is that of **software processes**.
