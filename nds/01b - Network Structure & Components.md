# Functionality of Communications Systems
## Benefits
- Improves **information access and storing**.
- Allows **information sharing** (e.g.: shared folder with Dropbox).
- Allows **peripheral sharing** (e.g.: shared printer).
- Improves **communication between people** (e.g. instant messaging, blogs, social networks).
- Increases **processing capacity** (e.g.: distribution of software processes, cloud computing).
## Drawbacks
- Distribution of software processes is a complex and **error prone** task.
- **Network failures**.
- **Security concerns**.

# Categories of Networks
## Transmission Media
### Wired networks
- **Twisted-Pair Cable**: electrical signal; low immunity to noise; cheap; low-high bandwidth; high attenuation; easy installation.
- **Coaxial Cable**: electrical signal; higher immunity to noise; moderately expensive; moderately high bandwidth; low attenuation; fairly easy installation.
- **Fiber-Optic Cable**: optical signal; highest immunity to noise; expensive; very high bandwidth; low attenuation; difficult installation.
### Wireless networks
- **Infrared**: short-range communication system, aligned devices, low interference, short distance in a closed area.
- **Radio waves**: omnidirectional, penetrate walls, travel long distances.
- **Satellite microwave**: unidirectional, high latency, high bandwidth, not secure, very long distances.

## Geographical Coverage
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Creates communication between computer devices nearby. E.g.: WPAN, USB, Bluetooth
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Private network for connecting computer devices inside an office, lab, building or small campus. E.g.: WiFi, Ethernet. Interconnections with hubs, bridges or switches.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Covers a larger area than LAN, inside a city, public or private. E.g.: FDDI, WiMAX. Interconnections with routers or switches.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: provides long-distance transmission of multimedia data, covering a broad area (i.e., a country, continent, the whole world) using private or public network transports, but with a high lattency of messages. Interconnections of MAN, LAN, PAN networks with routers and switches.
