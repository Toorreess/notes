# System Programming
**Systems programming** is different of **user applications programming** in many ways:
- Interaction with operating system and hardware.
- Real time is important: you have to know how to manage it.
- Scripting Languages.
- All approaches and abstractions of conventional programming do not well suit. Memory management is different.
- New abstractions are needed to deal with concurrency.

In this course, we are focusing on:
- Memory management and low level programming with the C language.
- Studying concurrency as the main and more important abstraction in Systems Programming. nd also in:
  - Distributed and Parallel Systems
  - Communications
  - Real Time Systems
- Studying Event based Programming and how this is usually combined with concurrency.
- GUI design by combining both techniques.
