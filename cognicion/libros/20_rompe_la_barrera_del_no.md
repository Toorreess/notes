# Introduction
- Chris Voss (author) -> Retired FBI negociator
- Aims to help people negotiate better outcomes by undestanding underlying emotions

# Importance of Negotiation
- People want ot feel understood & accepted
- Tactical Empathy: Understanding, listening and acknowledging the other party's feelings
- Ton of voice can change the way your message is received


# Mirroring
- Repeat the last 3 words that the other person says
- It works bc:
    - Shows that you're actively listening
    - When people feel heard, they are more likely to open up to you


# Labeling
- Name the emotions the other aprty is feeling
- It works bc:
    - It shows empathy, shows u understand their feelings
    - Allows them to express themselves fully


# The ability to get to "That's Right"
- Goal: to be able to summarize the other person's concerns accurately to make them feel udnerstood
- Works with mriroring & labelling


# The Power of "No"
- "No as a start": No can have many meanings:
- Different types of "Yes":
    - Counterfeit "yes" -> Temporary escape
    - Confirmation "yes" -> affirmation
    - Commitment "yes" -> genuine agreement


# Calibrated Questions
- Asking "What" or "How" Questions. AVOID asking "Why"
- Goal: To get the other person to reveal more information.


# Emotional Anchoring & Framing
- Anchor emotions: Start with their emotions before discussing numbers
- Frame negotiation: Focus on fairness; aim for good outcomes for both sides.


# Rule of three
- Goal: Get the other person to agree three times:
    1. Verbally
    2. In writing
    3. Actionable steps


# Finding the Black Swan
- Uncover hidden/unexpected info that changes the dynamic of the negotiation. 

Three types of leverage:
1. Positive leverage. Offerin something the other peroson wants
2. Negative leverage. Highlighting what they could to lose
3. Normative leverage. Using their own norms & standards to change their mind.


# The ready-to-walk mindset
- Willingness to walk: be ready to walk away of the negotiation doesn't meet your needs.
